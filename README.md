# replicated-log iteration 2
## Requirements

In the previous iteration, the replication was blocking for all secondaries, i.e. to return a response to the client we should receive acknowledgements (ACK) from all secondaries.



Current iteration should provide tunable semi-synchronicity for replication, by defining write concern parameters. </br>
client POST request in addition to the message should also contain write concern parameter w=1,2,3,..,n </br>
w value specifies how many ACKs the master should receive from secondaries before responding to the client:
* w = 1 - only from master
* w = 2 - from master and one secondary
* w = 3 - from master and two secondaries

Please emulate the replicaâ€™s inconsistency (and eventual consistency) with the master by introducing the artificial delay on the secondary node. In this case, the master and secondary should temporarily return different lists of messages. </br>
Add logic for messages deduplication and to guarantee the total ordering of messages. </br>


## Development
Replication is reworked to be asynchronous, to see implementation check [ReplicatedLogRepository](src/main/java/org/vkartashov/log/repository/ReplicatedLogRepository.java) </br>
To release request execution thread, Countdown latch is used.</br>

Ordering number has been introduced to ensure correct ordering on replicas. All log entries are put into TreeSet with ordering through order number. </br>
## How to run
Java 17 is required to be installed on local environment </br>
Run with command for Mac/Linux:
```bash
./up.sh
```

## Results
MasterLogController is entry point for handling append log entry request.</br>
As we see thread is released straight away and message is replicated in background</br>

Write concern 2. Thread is released after one of replications has been done. Other replica is artificially delayed for 7 sec.

Write concern 3. Thread is released after both replications are done.
